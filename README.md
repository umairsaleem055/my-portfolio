Digital Portfolio

This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created my own digital portfolio because I wanted to start learning web development and get some insights into it. My goal was to learn a real skill, and I thought the best way to do that was by making a project.

For this project, I took help from ChatGPT as my learning partner. At each step, I asked questions like why, how, and what does this mean so that I could understand instead of just copy-pasting code. It took me around 7 days to complete this project.

What I built

-> A navigation bar

-> Fade-in transition animations

-> Scroll animations using JavaScript

-> A responsive layout for desktop and mobile

-> A complete custom design (I didn’t copy-paste from anywhere; I built the layout as I wanted)

What I learned

In the beginning, I didn’t realize my website wasn’t responsive for mobile screens. After a few days, I started working on that problem and learned about media queries. Finally, I made my website responsive for small screens as well.

Through this project, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and a little bit about JavaScript. After finishing, I also watched tutorials to understand HTML and CSS more deeply. Now, I can confidently say that I am able to create my portfolio from scratch without any help. I also fixed and improved many parts of my portfolio on my own.

Later, I made a practice website to try out different HTML and CSS things, and I will upload that on my GitHub too.

Reflection

I started this project to learn HTML and CSS, and I can confidently say that I succeeded. Without going to any institute or school, I learned web development at home and added this skill to my profile.

This project motivated me a lot, and I am excited to build more projects in the future to make my portfolio even stronger.
